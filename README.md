# Elevator Simulator

A 7-floor elevator controller simulator built with React. Use it to visualize hall-call priorities, cabin selections, and dynamic door behavior.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The simulator runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized bundle is emitted to `build/` and is ready for hosting (e.g. Vercel or any static host).

## Key Features

- Direction-aware dispatcher that honors hall calls before reversing
- Distinct cabin and hall controls with live status messaging
- Polished UI styling that mimics a real elevator panel

## Scripts

- `npm test` – run the interactive test runner
- `npm run eject` – copy CRA configs locally (irreversible)
